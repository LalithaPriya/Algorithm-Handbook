Python:

--> Access/ read the elements from end of the list: by using negative indexing 
	nums[-1] --> to get the last index 
	nums[-4] --> to get the 4th index value from the end of the list 

--> Slicing i.e accessing multiple elements(range) in the array at a time.
	nums[start:stop] --> fetch the values from start index to stop index
	nums[start: stop: step] --> fetch the values from start index to stop index, but here we use step to get results
	
--> Negative slicing similar to slicing:
	ex : nums[-4:-1] --> 4th element to last element

--> The step size might also be a negative number. The slicing direction is changed over by doing this. This indicates that 
	the slicing begins from sequence[stop + 1] and ends at sequence[start].
	ex: part = nums[4:1:-1]

--> To fetch list from 0th index to some specific index:
	ex:nums[:4]

--> TO fetch from some element to the end of the list:
	ex: nums[4:]

--> Need to clone the list, then
	ex: ls = nums[::]

-->  Ex: ls = nums[::2] --> 2 refers to step size

-->  Ex: ls nums[::-1] --> -1 reverse the slicing here # ls = [5,4,3,2,1] 
-->  Ex: ls = nums[::-2] --> #ls = [5,3,1]
